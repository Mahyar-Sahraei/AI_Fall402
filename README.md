## A Brief Description
### 1. Search
Trying to find a solution to the Sokoban game using
A*, BFS and DFS search algorithms.

### 2. Optimization
Finding an optimal point to build a hospital between 3 
cities that have different populations.

A simple solution to this problem is to calculate a
weighted mean, but the code uses an iterative method on purpose.

### 3. NLP
Training a model to predict if a text's subject is political or 
is related to sports. It uses Document-Term Matrix, PCA and linear regression.

### 4. Genetic
A genetic algorithm to solve a set of three equations with 3
parameters. Note that not every set of parameters has a solution.

### 5. Game
Using minimax to play Dots and Boxes. To avoid big branching factors, 
some reduction techniques must be used.

### 6. CSP
Short for Constraint Satisfaction Problems. As an example of these
problems, this program solves an N by N sudoku (No constraint on 3x3 boxes) using
AC3 algorithm and forward checking to reduce backtracking.
